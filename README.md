Time difference calculation app in Angular

This is a simple app to measure time difference between two given times. Angular is used to make it more dynamic. The so-called "app" is yet in its skeleton stage with no CSS. Would like to have your contribution, and I'm curious about how it grows with a public contribution. 

#Summary
1.  Technologies used - HTML5, Angular.js
2.  Functionalities -
      *User enters start time in HH:MM am/pm format.
      *Then only the second input group - 'end time' is shown in same time format.
      *The time difference change is visible on the go, as user changes the values using input boxes(input type="number").
      *AM or PM will be a radio button.
