Angular is used to make it more dynamic. The so-called \"app\" is yet in its skeleton stage with no CSS. \r\n*Would like to have your contribution, and I'm curious about how it grows with a public contribution.* \r\n\r\n##Summary\r\n1.  Technologies used - HTML5, Angular.js\r\n2.  Functionalities -\r\n      1.  User enters start time in HH:MM am/pm format.\r\n      2.  Then only the second input group - 'end time' is shown in same time format.\r\n      3.  The time difference change is visible on the go, as user changes the values using input boxes(input type=\"number\").\r\n      4.  AM or PM will be a radio button.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
